## Resources
Some git repos for agda courses:
* https://github.com/pigworker/CS410-17
* https://github.com/pigworker/CS410-18

Nice exercises and approach (imo), with the huge bonus of having recorded [video lectures](https://github.com/pigworker/CS410-17#lecture-videos-on-youtube).

[PLFA](https://plfa.github.io/) - A loose adaptation of the [popular Coq based book](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/) to Agda.

Good for a gentle introduction, and some exercises. Also for lambda calculus related things in Agda.
